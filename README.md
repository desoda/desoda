- 🤘 Hello. Hey. Hi. I’m @desoda on GitHub. Aka Antisoda. Aka soda.
- 👇 This is just a thrown-together README.md file to quickly introduce myself.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, webdesign, 3D-printing and photography.
- 💾 I’m a computer nerd at heart.
- 👨‍💻 I’m an IT professional by trade and my field is computer and server fault diagnosis and repair.
- 🔤 My first introduction to programming was, as with most of my generation, BASIC. Locomotive BASIC on the Amstrad CPC464, to be exact. 8bitFTW! 😊
- 🎓 My only **formal** education in proramming was _Turbo Pascal 5.5_. Not a highly sought-after programming language today, I grant you, but it laid a base for me learning programming in general.
- ⌨️ I’m self-taught in languages like C and C#. I’ve pretty much avoided C++.
- 👾 I’ve dipped my toes into Unity, ever so slightly, though the [Unity fee controversy](https://gist.github.com/runevision/1c0d6a856dda1461577cf7f84574253a) has slightly dampened _any_ desire of mine to explore that engine.
- 🕸️ I do have _some_ experience with web development, like PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc, but as with C and C#, all self-taught.
- 🎨 My knowledge of webdesign is also all self taught, and, alas, pretty basic. _Color theory, what is that?_
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a slightly more structured setting. Hopefully with some excursions into React or other JS frameworks.
